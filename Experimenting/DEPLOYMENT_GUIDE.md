## 🎯 AI Grading Algorithm

### Physical Performance (40% weight)
**Evaluation Factors:**
- Height/weight ratio (BMI consideration)
- 40-yard dash time vs sport benchmarks
- Vertical jump vs sport standards
- Strength measurements (bench press, squat)
- Age-adjusted performance curves
- Experience factor weighting

**Sport-Specific Benchmarks:**
Each sport has customized performance thresholds:
- Football: Emphasizes power and speed
- Basketball: Focuses on vertical leap and agility
- Soccer: Prioritizes endurance and agility
- Track & Field: Speed and explosive power
- And 11 more sports...

### Academic Achievement (35% weight)
**Evaluation Factors:**
- GPA (heavily weighted at 40% of academic score)
- SAT/ACT standardized test performance
- Advanced Placement course load
- Honors class participation
- Class rank percentile
- Academic trajectory indicators

### Highlight Reel Analysis (25% weight)
**AI Analysis Components:**
- Platform quality recognition (Hudl +15, YouTube +10, etc.)

## 🔧 Configuration & Customization

### Adding New Sports
1. Insert into sports table:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO sports (name, category) VALUES ('New Sport', 'Category');
   ```

2. Add benchmarks in `backend/services/aiGrading.js`:
   ```javascript
   'New Sport': {
     fortyYard: { excellent: 4.2, good: 4.5, average: 4.8, poor: 5.1 },
     vertical: { excellent: 35, good: 30, average: 25, poor: 20 }
   }
   ```

### Adjusting Grading Weights
Modify weights in `aiGrading.js`:
```javascript
calculateOverallGrade(physicalGrade, academicGrade, highlightGrade) {
  // Current: Physical 40%, Academic 35%, Highlight 25%
  // Customize as needed:
  const weightedScore = (physicalGrade × 0.4) + (academicGrade × 0.35) + (highlightGrade × 0.25);
